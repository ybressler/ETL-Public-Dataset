Use this to manage migrations.


# Getting Started
When you first clone this repo and want to bring your local database up to date, execute
the following: `alembic -c database/migrations_manager/alembic.ini upgrade head`

***If this fails***, stamp the head and then upgrade:
* `alembic -c database/migrations_manager/alembic.ini stamp head`
* `alembic -c database/migrations_manager/alembic.ini upgrade head`

# Making Migrations (Semi-Automated Commands)
Run the following command: `bash database/migrations_manager/run_alembic.sh -m "message" -u -r`
* `-m` is the revision message which will be passed to alembic
* `-u` is an optional flag which will upgrade the db to the current head.
* `-r` is an optional flag which will generate an erd.


# Making Migrations (Individual commands)
1. Navigate to the migrations manager directory (should fix this...) `cd database/migrations_manager`
2. Make the revision `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "My message" `
3. Edit the revision file if necessary _(double check when renaming)_
4. Upgrade with the following: `alembic upgrade head`
